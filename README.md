## Inspiration
Cloud kitchen is the fastest-growing business in the food and hospitality sector in India. Current management tools cater to physical restaurants and are not made to serve the unique challenges cloud kitchens face. We identified this gap in the market and plan to monetise on it.

## What it does
It is an all-in-one management system that streamlines processes like inventory, sales, team, menu management, and more. We are currently the most comprehensive solution in the market.

## How we built it
We built it for scale while keeping our tech debt low by applying the most proven industry practices. Our Tech Stack:

1. NextJS - full-stack framework
2. tRPC - typesafe end-to-end server framework
3. Prisma - ORM
4. Clerk - Authentication
5. Postgres - Database
6. Tailwind - CSS utility
7. Zod - Validation
8. RadixUI - Accessbile UI Components
9. eslint, prettier, etc - linting & formatting
    
## Challenges we ran into
Our project was too broad to finish in the given time. So, we had to work really hard to nail down one hero feature for our demo.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to come up with a good solution to a genuine pain point that business owners face. We hope to continue our project past this hackathon.

## What we learned
How effective Red Bull is for all-nighters, haha.

## What's next for RasoiHub
We will go down our feature list and pitch our MVP to our friend's father, who owns a cloud kitchen in India.
